# Object Detection with YOLO

Welcome to my first hands-on experiment with YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection! This repository is where I document my learning journey, covering everything from dataset selection to labeling and model training. If you're new to YOLO or looking for practical insights, I hope this repository will be useful to you.

## About This Project
This project serves as my introduction to YOLO-based object detection. As this is my first time working with YOLO, I am experimenting with different settings and approaches to better understand how the model works. I will be testing:
- Dataset preparation and annotation
- Training configurations
- Model performance evaluation

By following this repository, you can see my workflow and potentially use it as a reference for your own projects.

## Dataset
For this experiment, I am using a **car object detection dataset**, which you can find at the following link:
[Car Object Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)

Alternatively, you can use any dataset of your choice from platforms such as:
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Open Images Dataset V7](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)

This dataset is already formatted and prepared for object detection, but I am also experimenting with labeling the images manually to gain deeper insights into data annotation.

## Labeling the Dataset
Labeling is a crucial step in training an object detection model. For this, I used [CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)](https://www.cvat.ai/), which provides a user-friendly interface for labeling images.

If you want to label your dataset manually, you can follow these steps:
1. Upload your dataset to CVAT.
2. Draw bounding boxes around objects of interest.
3. Assign class labels to each object.
4. Export the labeled dataset in YOLO format.

These labels will later be used for training the YOLO model.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains:
- **Dataset and Annotations**: The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Training Scripts**: Scripts to preprocess the dataset and train YOLO.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Methods to analyze model performance.
- **Experimentation Notes**: Details on different configurations and results.

More details on how to run the scripts and replicate the experiments will be added as I progress.

## Goals & Future Work
- Understand how YOLO handles real-world object detection tasks.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and dataset sizes.
- Improve labeling techniques and optimize training results.
- Compare results across different YOLO versions (YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, etc.).

## Conclusion
This project is a hands-on learning experience with YOLO. I encourage you to explore the dataset, experiment with different settings, and share your insights. If you find this repository useful, feel free to contribute or provide feedback!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
